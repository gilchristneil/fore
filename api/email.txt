- If price above 200 moving average (hold alert) and bearish shark ended = send buy alert
- If price above 200 moving average (hold alert) and bullish shark ended = do nothing
- If price below 200 moving average (hold alert) and bearish shark ended alert = do nothing
- if price below 200 moving average (hold alert) and bullish shark ended alert = send sell alert

That's it! I guess there would be 4 webhooks in total:
1. Price above 200MA
2. Price below 200MA
3. Bearish shark ended
4. Bullish shark ended
